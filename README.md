# GuitarPro-to-Midi

Build the program by running `./build` and then simply run `mono Convert.exe <gp-file-name>` (mono is a tool used for running C# code in the terminal).
A file "output.mid" will be created in the home folder of your Unity project.

(The cs-files in this repo are just for quick access and needn't be downloaded.)

Features:
- Reading GuitarPro 3 - 5 Files (based on the open python pyGuitarPro project)
- Reading GuitarPro 6 Files (using a simple bitwise compression and an xml structure with dictionary and ids)
- Reading GuitarPro 7 Files (packed like a normal zip-file and using a very large xml structure)
- Transferring all files into a common native format that saves all (and only) the information that are interesting for midi files. I.e. a lot of information like fingering or guitar amp preferences are ignored.
- Splitting to a secondary channel for certain effects
- Exporting to Midi, trying to simulate the sound as best as possible:
  Simulating:
    - Different types of harmonics
    - Strum patterns
    - Bending - as far as the midi standard allows
    - Trembar - "
    - Volume knob effects
    - Muted notes
    - Vibratos
    - and perhaps more..

 (I must mention that GuitarPro's native Midi export lacks far behind in this functionality!)

 Please enjoy and create some great software with this!
